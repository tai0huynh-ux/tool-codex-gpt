### Goal

Make repository state recoverable without prior chat history.

### Changes

Added continuity documents, machine-readable state and schema, a read-only status helper, validation tests, two project skills, and startup instructions in `AGENTS.md`.

### Files

`docs/continuity`, `docs/adr`, `.agent-state`, `.agents/skills`, `scripts/project-status.mjs`, root test configuration, and `AGENTS.md`.

### Decisions

Use symbolic Git references in state (`HEAD`, `origin/main`, and `STATE_FILE_COMMIT`) because a committed file cannot contain its own final cryptographic commit hash. Resolve them through the status helper and Git.

### Verification

Baseline full verification passed before the checkpoint. The final gate passed with 19 Vitest tests, one Chromium Playwright test, formatting, lint, strict type-check, and all builds. Both project skills passed the official validator, and the read-only status helper returned the expected repository state.

### Failures encountered

The skill initializer initially failed to print a Unicode workspace path under the Windows legacy code page.

### Root causes

Python used the active Windows character map while the repository path contains Vietnamese characters.

### Fixes

Reran the official initializer with `PYTHONUTF8=1`; no files were created outside the repository.

### Commit

Resolve with `git log -1 -- docs/continuity/WORKLOG.md`.

### Push

Verify with `git fetch origin`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `git rev-parse origin/main`; the hashes must match.

### Next action

Implement `P1-TOOL-001` exactly as described in `RECOVERY.md`.
